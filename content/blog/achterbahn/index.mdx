Achterbahn is the German word for rollercoaster and that's one way I'd describe the past year. Ups and downs.

At some point, I legit questioned if I was a good person because it seemed like good things were not happening for/to me (after-all good things happen to good people right?).

I could summarize my whole year into one single event; me moving to Berlin, and at some point it looked like that wasn't going to happen at all.

This year was this 👌🏾 close to being a bad year but I'm so happy for the turnaround and most especially for this past month. Good things have been happening to me and for that I'm grateful.

So happy birthday ye 🎉
