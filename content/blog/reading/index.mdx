I saw a tweet the other day where the OP said they can enjoy reading a book and get asked, "oh what was that book about?" And be like "nope, I canâ€™t remember any single thing".

And I have to say I relate. I got back into reading last year and I donâ€™t even know if I can explain the summary of most of the books I read. All I remember is having a good time turning the pages, cussing out characters, and looking up and checking if anyone on the train caught me laughing at the jokes.

Itâ€™s just like movies, you don't necessarily remember every single scene, but you just remember having a nice time watching.

Here's to more escapism in books ðŸ¥‚ðŸ“š
